## Session Summary (August 1, 2025)

**Goal:** Fix the broken application layout.

**Challenges & Debugging Steps:**

1.  **Initial State:** The application layout was completely broken, with components stacked vertically and unstyled.
2.  **Tailwind/Styling Investigation:** We spent a significant amount of time investigating the Tailwind CSS and PostCSS configuration, believing it to be the root cause. This was a red herring.
3.  **Dependency Hell:** We then suspected dependency issues, leading to multiple uninstalls, reinstalls, and version pinning attempts with Tailwind and its related packages. This also did not solve the core problem.
4.  **The Switch to Chakra UI:** After exhausting all options with the Tailwind-based stack, we made the decision to pivot to a more integrated component library, **Chakra UI**, to simplify the toolchain and eliminate potential conflicts.
5.  **Chakra UI Integration Issues:** The transition to Chakra UI was not smooth and introduced a series of new, specific errors:
    *   `Module not found: Can't resolve '@chakra-ui/react'`: Solved by performing a complete, clean reinstall of all dependencies (`rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json` and `docker-compose build --no-cache`).
    *   `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '_config')`: Solved by creating a dedicated `theme.ts` file and using the `@chakra-ui/next-js` `CacheProvider`.
    *   `Attempted import error: 'useStyleConfig' is not exported`: This was the most persistent error, caused by incompatible versions between `@chakra-ui/react` and `@chakra-ui/next-js`. The final solution was to pin the exact, known-good versions:
        *   `@chakra-ui/react`: `2.8.0`
        *   `@chakra-ui/next-js`: `2.1.5`
    *   `Build Error: It's currently unsupported to use "export *" in a client boundary`: Solved by adding `@chakra-ui/react` to the `serverExternalPackages` list in `next.config.ts`.
    *   `Invalid hook call`: This was the final major hurdle, caused by forgetting to add the `'use client'` directive to all components that use Chakra UI. Since Chakra components use hooks, any component that renders them must be a Client Component.

**Resolution:**

After a lengthy and difficult debugging process, the layout is now correctly rendered using a stable Chakra UI foundation. The key takeaways are:

*   **Dependency Versioning is Critical:** Mismatched versions between related packages can cause cryptic and misleading errors.
*   **Server vs. Client Components:** Understanding the distinction in the Next.js App Router is non-negotiable. Any component using React hooks (which includes most UI libraries) must be explicitly marked with `'use client'`.
*   **Clean Builds are Essential:** When in doubt, a full dependency wipe and a `--no-cache` Docker rebuild is the most reliable way to solve stubborn dependency issues.

**Outcome:**

*   The application now has a stable layout foundation using Chakra UI.
*   Project documentation has been updated to reflect the new technology stack.
*   The codebase is ready for further UI development.
